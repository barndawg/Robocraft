# Robocraft Tips App
I'm working on this Overwolf app for the Nvidia App Challenge. It's my first ever OV app, so it's going to be fairly crude in
its early stages.

# What it actually does
At the moment? Not much. Soon it will show you tips relevant to what you are doing in-game, and (possibly) comment on your
Robot design, tell you which enemy players are safe to attack, and other stuff like that.

# Name suggestions
I have no idea what to call this. I'm open to suggestions....
